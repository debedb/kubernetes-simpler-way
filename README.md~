# Kubernetes simpler way

Inspired by Kelsey's [Kubernetes The Hard
Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way),
these are just notes from installing Kubernetes for my own purposes
(largely, [development](http://romana.io/) and research). This, of
course, is not intended to be anywhere near production.
